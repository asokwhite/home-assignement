## The Task

### Assignement

[UI Mockup](https://www.figma.com/file/19u0uVDez4SVYbW95MyihP/Test-Ui?node-id=0%3A1)

The task is to create an app that uses the provided data about football competitions. User can select a competition from a list, then a page with a list of matches is shown. Also a list of teams in the competition is shown. User is able to see players belonging to a team. 

Use the data anyway you want to create an API that will provide this data to frontend. The frontend app can either be built using ajax from twig view or full React SPA. The choice it up to you.

The choice of styling methods and visual style is also up to you. 

To share your changes with us, create a fork of this repo, and when you are finished create a merge request to our main branch. We will then walk through your code, make code review and maybe have a chat about it in an online interview.
